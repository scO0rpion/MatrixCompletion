# MatrixCompletion
In this repositories I have implemented several basic algorithms in Optimization. The first notebook deals with a optimization problem that you have multiple constraints for which you know how to project on each of them individually. The goal is to project on the intersection of your constraints.  

The second notebook entails simple Matrix Completion examples where I have implemented non-Convex projection method. Other optimization methods were also applied in order to compare. The most stable ones were Proximal Gradient Descent.
